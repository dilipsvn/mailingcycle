                    A message may contain special place holders and wild cards. </p>
                    <p> An example of a special place holder is
                    {ON_DESIGN_NAME}. Such place holders will be replaced by the agent name specified while creating the design.
                     </p>
                     <p>An example of wild cards is [He understands/She understands/They understand]. Based on the gender information
                     specified while creating the design, the appropriate wild card will be used. If gender is specified as "Male", the
                     first part (i.e. He understands) will be used in place of the wild cards. 
                     If gender is specified as "Female", the second part (i.e. She understands)
                     will be used in place of the wild cards. 
                     If gender is specified as "Group", the third part (i.e. They understand) will be used in place of the wild cards..</p>
