                A password is one that's difficult for others to determine by guessing or by using
                automated programs. A password is an important first step in protecting your personal
                information. A password:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                <li>
                Contains 7 to 20 characters.
                <li>Uses the following three types of characters:

                        <li>
                        Letters (A, B, C, a, b, c).
                        <li>
                        Numerals (1, 2, 3).
                        <li>Symbols (` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ &amp; * ( ) _ + - = { } | [ ] \ : " ; ' &lt; &gt; ? , .
                            /). </li>

                    A password can be guessed. People who have enough time and computing power can eventually
                    determine any password. To help protect your personal information, security experts
                    recommend that you change your password regularly and avoid repeating the previously
                    used passwords.
                    <li>
                    Passwords are case sensitive.
                    <li>
                    To help secure your personal information, don't write down your password, or share
                    it with anyone else.
                    <li>
                    Mailing Cycle will never ask you for your password in an e-mail message. Be cautious
                    of unsolicited e-mail messages that appear to be from Mailing Cycle and provide
                    a link for you to sign in to your account. Someone may be impersonating the Mailing
                    Cycle to get your password.
                    <li>
                    Isn't a common word or name, or a close variation on a common word or name.
