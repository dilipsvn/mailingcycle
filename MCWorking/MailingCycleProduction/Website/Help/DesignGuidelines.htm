                Design Guidelines</h5>
            The print management of the cards for agents involves a variety of issues. These
            cards come in different sizes, shape and can have customized images and text message
            layouts.

                    Size
                </p>
                Agents can choose from 3 standard sizes (one sample size shown below – rectangular
                in shape – half of the standard 8.5 x 11; Other designs involves square and a different
                size). However custom size is possible for selection for different pricing.

                    Justification
                </p>
                Cards can be Right (R) or Left (L) justified. This justification is about the positioning
                of the image on left or right side as show in one sample. Justification relates
                to the positioning of "message" that would be superimposed on the PowerKard, before
                printing and mailing happens
